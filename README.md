# GOLAD
A Javascript version of [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh)'s GOLAD

GOLAD is a game created and developed by Cary Huang [available for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/game-of-life-and-death/id1156743291?mt=8). GOLAD is a two-player strategy game based in [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). The board starts with a fair random distribution of cells, half of them owned by each player. At each turn, players can kill a cell or give birth to an own cell and the objective is to destroy all the opponent's cells. My edition doesn't include a tutorial, so you can watch the complete instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkGZ2Hl1l8c&t=3s), in the creator's youtube channel.

I made this version as an alternative for those who don't own an iOS device. Thus, it lacks of some features (such as online games, timer and save and load from string) so if you have an iOS device, I strongly recommend using that version instead, which is way better. Also, there is another PC edition made in Java by hanss314 which you can find [here](https://github.com/hanss314/GOLAD).

You can start playing GOLAD directly from [this page](https://popclom.github.io/GOLAD/), or you can [click here](https://github.com/PopClom/GOLAD/archive/master.zip) to download the repository to your computer, and then extract the .ZIP and open index.html. I would like to add that if you have a poor performance (low fps), it's advisable to disable the animations.

For any bug or request, you can go to the [issues page](https://github.com/PopClom/GOLAD/issues) and submit it.
